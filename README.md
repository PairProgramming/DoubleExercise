Pairing Kata for practising with Doubles

This exercise involves working with a tube train and station domain.  Tube trains should have a current station which can be changed.  The precise details of the domain (which most commuters will be able to relate to) are less important than ensuring the tests for the tube train class are independent of the station class and vice versa.  Using doubles is a good way to achieve this.

See [https://github.com/tansaku/DoubleExercise](https://github.com/tansaku/DoubleExercise) for an example start on this domain and [these commits](https://github.com/tansaku/DoubleExercise/commits/master) for an example of the github pong pairing style.

Please fork and clone this repository to get set up for github pong.  To get ready to github pong with your partner execute the following git command in your DoubleExercise directory:

`git remote add <partner-name> <partner-repo>`
  
For example to github pong with sam:

`git remote add sam https://github.com/tansaku/DoubleExercise`
